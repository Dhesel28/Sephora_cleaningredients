# Perfume Ingredients and Clean Label Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the composition of perfume ingredients and analyzes the prevalence of "Clean at Sephora" labels across various fragrance families. The analysis is aimed at helping consumers make informed decisions about fragrance products, especially during key shopping events like the Sephora Savings Event and Black Friday.

## Motivation
- Understand the most common ingredients used in different fragrance families.
- Examine the availability of "Clean at Sephora" labeled products and their impact on consumer choices.
- Identify top brands that are both popular and meet clean beauty standards.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a dataset containing detailed information about perfumes, including:
- **Fragrance Family**: Classification of each perfume.
- **Ingredients**: Cleaned and processed list of ingredients.
- **Clean at Sephora**: Indicator of whether a product meets Sephora's clean beauty standards.
- **Love Count**: Number of times a product has been marked as loved by users.

## Key Features
1. **Ingredient Analysis**: Visualization of the top ingredients in different fragrance families, highlighting the diversity and commonality of ingredients.
2. **Clean Label Distribution**: Stacked bar charts showing the proportion of clean versus non-clean perfumes in each fragrance family.
3. **Brand Popularity**: Bar charts showcasing the most loved clean brands, providing insights into consumer preferences.

## Visualizations
